`compose_spec` is a [Rust] library crate for (de)serializing from/to the [Compose specification].

`compose_spec` strives for:

- Idiomatic Rust ðŸ¦€
  - Uses semantically appropriate types from the standard library like `PathBuf` and `Duration`.
- Correctness
  - Values are fully validated and parsed.
  - Enums are used for fields which conflict with each other. For example, in `services`, `network_mode` and `networks` are combined into `network_config`.
- Ease of use
  - Fully documented, though the [documentation] could be fleshed out more with examples and explanations, help in this regard would be appreciated!
  - Helpful functions such as conversion between short and long syntax forms of values with multiple representations (e.g. `build` and `ports`).

See the [documentation] for more details.

## Examples

```rust
use compose_spec::{Compose, Service, service::Image};

let yaml = "\
services:
  caddy:
    image: docker.io/library/caddy:latest
    ports:
      - 8000:80
      - 8443:443
    volumes:
      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      - caddy-data:/data
volumes:
  caddy-data:
";

// Deserialize `Compose`
let compose: Compose = serde_yaml::from_str(yaml)?;

// Serialize `Compose`
let value = serde_yaml::to_value(&compose)?;

// Get the `Image` of the "caddy" service
let caddy: Option<&Service> = compose.services.get("caddy");
let image: &Option<Image> = &caddy.unwrap().image;
let image: &Image = image.as_ref().unwrap();

assert_eq!(image, "docker.io/library/caddy:latest");
assert_eq!(image.name(), "docker.io/library/caddy");
assert_eq!(image.tag(), Some("latest"));
```

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

The minimum version of the Rust compiler `compose_spec` can currently compile with is 1.70, which is tested in CI.
Increasing the MSRV is **not** considered to be a breaking change.

## Contribution

Contributions, suggestions, and/or comments are appreciated! Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/k9withabone/compose_spec_rs/issues), [discussion](https://github.com/k9withabone/compose_spec_rs/discussions), or [pull request](https://github.com/k9withabone/compose_spec_rs/pulls).
Generally, it is preferable to start a discussion for a feature request or open an issue for reporting a bug before submitting changes with a pull request.

### Project Layout

`compose_spec` is composed of two packages set up in a Cargo workspace. The root package, `compose_spec`, is the main library.
The other package, `compose_spec_macros`, located in a directory of the same name, is a procedural macro library used in `compose_spec`. `compose_spec_macros` is not designed to be used outside the `compose_spec` library.
